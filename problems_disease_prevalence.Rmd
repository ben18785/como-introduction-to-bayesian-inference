## Aim
Suppose we collect data $X = 4$ individuals testing positive for a disease in a sample of size $N = 10$. Our aim is to estimate the disease prevalence, $\theta$, in the population the individuals were sampled from.

## Determining an appropriate probability distribution
1. Why would you not use a normal distribution to represent the model which generated the data?

2. Why would you not use a Poisson distribution?

3. Why might a binomial distribution be an appropriate probability distribution?

4. Plot the binomial distribution with $N=10$ and show how it varies across $\theta = (0.1, 0.5, 0.9)$.

## Maximum likelihood estimation
5. Plot the likelihood function

6. What's the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$?

## Bayesian estimation
7. Assume that based on a previous meta-analysis, we have a prior $\theta\sim \text{beta}(1, 4)$. Plot the numerator of Bayes' rule: $p(\theta)\times p(X|\theta)$.

8. Using R's `integrate` function determine the denominator of Bayes' rule.

9. Hence make a function that yields the posterior density.

10. An alternative way to obtain the posterior distribution is to use conjugate prior rules. i.e. that if $\theta\sim \text{beta}(a, b)$ and $X|\theta\sim \mathcal{B}(N, \theta)$, then $\theta|X\sim \text{beta}(a + X, b + N - X)$. Use this relationship to investigate how the posterior changes holding $b=4$ and change from $a=1$ to $a=8$.

11. Calculate the posterior 10\%-90\% quantiles assuming $a=1$.

12. Forecast what data will be obtained in a second experiment, where $N=100$ assuming $a=1$. You can do this by sampling by iterating the following steps:

- $\theta_i \sim p(\theta|X)$, i.e. draw from the posterior distribution.
- $X_i \sim p(X|\theta_i)$, i.e. draw from the sampling distribution.

The distribution of $p(X)$ obtained via this process is known as the posterior predictive distribution. In your case, use 10,000 draws from this distribution then plot a histogram of the resultant draws.

13. Use your posterior predictive distribution to determine $Pr(X > 50)$ in a new experiment.
